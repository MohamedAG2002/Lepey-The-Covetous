# Lepey The Covetous
Lepey--a short, stubborn leprechaun--has a lust for coins. Since he was a child Lepey was obsessed with coins and, in fact, anything that is gold and shiny, which, usually, is coins. Help Lepey collect more coins to feed his evergrowing lust for the shiny gold circles while feeding your own lust for getting high scores at obscure shitty games.

## Credits
Thanks to the talented artist and musicians that I used in the projects. You can check their names on the *credits* screen in the game or the the creadits text file in the **Content** folder inside the project.

## How to use
If you want to dabble with or look at the masterpiece that is the *code*, you can clone the project and use your favorite IDE(which is hopefully VSCode) to load the project. If you want to build it, though, you need **Monogame** and **LDtkMonogame** to do that.

Otherwise, if you want to just play the game, you can head to the itch.io page for that.
